# Overview

This is a simple Hello World program that emulates a very simple 8-bit computer while displaying "Hello, World!"

The program sets up a class named *CPUVisualiser* that has 3 instructions; load, output, and halt. It takes a string, such as "Hello, World!" and appends each character to a list with each instruction in hex. Afterwards it will load that program into a 256-byte memory and run it. While it's running you will visually see what bits are in the registers and each command running the program.

This software is to demonstrate that my coding enviroment works.
